# Open Lineage

**Date:** 8th October 2021

Presenter: Mandy Chessell and ING

This session will describe how to set up an Egeria production system where lineage can be visualised based on metadata from multiple sources. It will explain the Open Lineage standard and the Open Lineage services - two different things using the words "Open Lineage".

This will include scenarios:

* metadata accessed using the OMRS repository connector proxy to a proprietary metadata repository
* A scenario with all open source content and no proprietary code.
* Lineage capture in various use cases
* Consolidated view
