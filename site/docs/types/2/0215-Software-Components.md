# 0215 Software Components

**DeployedSoftwareComponent** describes a code asset that is deployed to implement a 
[software capability](/egeria-docs/types/0/0042-Software-Server-Capabilities).
Each software component has a well defined interface describe by an [APISchema](/egeria-docs/types/5/0536-API-Schemas) that is
linked to the DeployedSoftwareComponent by the [AssetSchemaType](/egeria-docs/types/5/0503-Asset-Schema) relationship.

**DeployedConnector** represents specialist software component called a
**connector** that provides pluggable access to third party
technologies.  These connectors implement the [Open Connector Framework (OCF)](/egeria-docs/frameworks/ocf/overview)
interfaces.

**EmbeddedProcess** describes a processing element nested within a DeployedSoftwareComponent.
The **TransientEmbeddedProcess** describes an EmbeddedProcess that runs only for a short period of time.

These variations are used to provide more information for lineage graphs.

**ProcessHierarchy** defines a parent-child relationship between processes, which can be used to define
more abstract processes that are comprised of lower-level processes; helping to support navigating
the process hierarchy.
